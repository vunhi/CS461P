# PSU Locator

The Portland State campus is a large campus and it is often difficult to find a particular building or classroom, especially for those who are new to the campus. I know I surely felt that way when I first started taking classes at PSU. Actually, I still feel that way every time I register for classes each term and I have to figure out where my classrooms are. 

This Campus Locator Android mobile app will help Portland state students, faculty, and guests easily find the buildings and rooms that they are looking for.
