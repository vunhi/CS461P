# PSU Locator

The Portland State campus is a large campus and it is often difficult to find a particular building or classroom, especially for those who are new to the campus. I know I surely felt that way when I first started taking classes at PSU. Actually, I still feel that way every time I register for classes each term and I have to figure out where my classrooms are. 

Although there are campus maps on the web, I wanted to create something that is more convenient to use. This Campus Locator Android mobile app will help Portland state students, faculty, and guests easily find the buildings and rooms that they are looking for. 

# Week 3 Project Update

Right now the PSU locator has been successfully implemented for 2 rooms in 2 buildings on the campus. The user can search for a room within a building either by using the interactive map or through a search bar functionality. It was difficult working with the xml files in android studio at first, but I have gotten the hang of it. For the remainder of the term I will be improving the ease of use of the app as well as the general app theme and implementing functionality for ALL rooms for all buildings.
