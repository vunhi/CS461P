# PSU Locator

The Portland State campus is a large campus and it is often difficult to find a particular building or classroom, especially for those who are new to the campus. I know I surely felt that way when I first started taking classes at PSU. Actually, I still feel that way every time I register for classes each term and I have to figure out where my classrooms are. 

Although there are campus maps on the web, I wanted to create something that is more convenient to use. This Campus Locator Android mobile app will help Portland state students, faculty, and guests easily find the buildings and rooms that they are looking for. There is an interactive map of the campus where the user can click on the building to see the floorplans and there is also a search functionality where the user can enter in a building and/or room number to search. 

# Week 3 Project Update

Right now I have successfully implemented the interactive map aspect of the the PSU locator for one floor for one building on the campus. This is for the Cramer building. So when the user clicks on this building in the map they are taken to the basement floorplan of Cramer.

Now I must incorporate the option of choosing different floors and different rooms for each building. 

For the remainder of the term that is what I will be working on as well as adding the search functionality and improving the ease of use of the app as well as the general app theme. If I have time I hope to accomplish this for every floor and room number for each building (though that is quite a lot of buildings!). I also need to finish filling out the project ReadMe; as you can see, it's pretty bare right now. 

Some difficulties I'm facing: figuring out how to incorporate the interactive navigation bar for each page. Also, I find that working with the android xml files is very difficult. Using the design function is not as intuitive as it seems: dragging widgets across the screen is not entirely smooth and it can throw off the layout of all other widgets on the screen. And even though the layout appears one way on the projected screen in AS it is soemtimes not the same as what appears on the actual phone screen. This is a very stressful obstacle to overcome.
