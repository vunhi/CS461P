## Description

The PSU locator is an android application that helps users navigate their way through the large Portland State campus, specifically by helping the user to locate a specific room in the campus. There are 3 key features in this mobile app: 1) an interactive map, 2) a search function, and 3) a favorites page. The user can navigate through the campus and find information for a building through the interactive campus map, they can search for a room through the search function, and they can save locations to a Favorites page for future use.
