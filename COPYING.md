This project was adapted from another Office Locator application that was specifically designed for the Nike campus for a Capstone class for which I was a part of. This was also an open source project and the source code for that version can be found here: https://github.com/cnorton18/capstone2017/tree/Markers. Although this PSU Locator was based off of this group capstone project, I have taken only source code that I and my partner Victor Diego worked on and have modified and added my own additional code to it. He has granted me permission to use his work in this application.
