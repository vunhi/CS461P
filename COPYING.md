This project was adapted from the Office Locator application that was specifically designed for the Nike campus for a class this term for which I was a part of. This was also an open source project and the source code for that version can be found here: https://github.com/vunhi/CS461P/blob/master/OfficeLocator.rar. The two projects were developed concurrently. Although this PSU Locator was based off of this group capstone project, I have taken only source code that I and my partner Victor Diego worked on and have modified and added my own additional code to it (the rest of the group's work has been excluded). Victor has granted me permission to use this work in this application.
